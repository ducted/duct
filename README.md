Duct is an event gateway, poller and router. It can collect metrics or events from multiple sources, and output them to multiple destinations - currently supprort for Elasticsearch and Riemann is included but Duct is designed to be easily extensible through its plugin API.

(If you came looking for a maths framework I apologise for the deception.)
